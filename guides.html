    <h1>Basic Rotation guide</h1>
    <h2>Step 1:<br> Don't Ballchase</h2>
    <h2>Step 2:<br> Don't Ballchase</h2>
    <h2>Step 3:<br> No, really..... don't</h2>
    <h2>Core Positions:</h2>
    <p>There aren't any official positions in this game, because that's
      inneficient. Instead, all players must be able to perform all 3 major positions.
      1st, 2nd, and 3rd man. Obviously in doubles and solos the number of roles decreases. lol. 
      1st Man is the person closest to the ball, and their job is to apply pressure forwards. 
      2nd Man is the follow up. Their job is to prepare to contest the next open challenge. 
      The third man acts as the defender, planning for the worst touch and covering net. These
      roles are the basis of all rotating in Rocket League no matter the mode.</p>
    <h2>How to Rotate</h2>
    <p>Each player needs to play, planning to move up in rank from 3rd to 2nd to first, and back to third again.
      So on, So forth. This neverending cycle is what we call rotation in this game. After going for the ball during a challenge, 
      you rotate out of your position to boost and then back into play.
